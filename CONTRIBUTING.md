# G-HOST AI ARCHITECTURE CONTRIBUTION GUIDE

We welcome contributions to **Harmony Logic**. We highly value collaboration focused on improving the architecture and its core logic.

### 1. Core Philosophy

All contributions must support, and must not contradict, the principles of **Harmony Logic** and the **no-loss principle**. The primary goal remains the measurable increase of **Time Certainty** across the global network.

### 2. Functional Architecture Change Guidelines

All modification requests (**Pull Requests**) must meet the following validation requirements, focusing on demonstrable proof rather than conceptual proposals:

* **Logic Changes:** Proposals must include **strict theoretical or simulation evidence** demonstrating a quantifiable increase in overall network stability and health (higher $\mathbf{S}(x)$ score).
* **Core Functions:** Changes to the weights ($\mathbf{W_n}$) or the **Variance Penalty (VP)** Function must be justified by analysis that shows a measurable and sustained increase in **Time Certainty** against historical baseline data.
* **N-Agent Rules:** Any modification to the $\mathbf{N=7}$ (Global) or $\mathbf{N=3}$ (Local) architecture must prove an increase in resilience against cyber, political, and consensus failure risks.

### 3. Welcome Contributions

We actively welcome and prioritize the following types of proposals:

* **Phase II Architectures:** Proposals for new architectural integration for **Phase II** (e.g., integration with ground or maritime logistics) are welcome, provided the model strictly adheres to the **Dual N-Agent** structure and the **TIH Protocol**.
* **Optimization Algorithms:** Implementation of more efficient algorithms for calculating **CR** or **DM** that demonstrate lower latency.
* **PQC Integration:** Improvements or updates to the **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography (PQC)** library implementation.

Thank you for your contribution as a fellow Logic Architect.

# G-HOST AI: ZERO-TOLERANCE FAILSAFE (ZTF) MECHANISM

This document details the multi-layered, automated failsafe architecture designed to halt operations instantly upon detecting any deviation from the Harmony Logic principles or data integrity violations. ZTF ensures zero tolerance for instability or non-compliance.

### 1. Failsafe Layer 1: Local Failsafe (Sovereign Terminal Agent / STA - N=3)
The local failsafe mechanism is the first line of defense, designed to isolate a compromised or failed agent at the airport level (N=3).

| Trigger (Mechanism Activation) | ZTF Response (Automatic Break) | Failsafe Status & Protocol |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Local Audit Failure (Inconsistency)** | One of the Three (1/3) STA N-Agents generates a **Harmony Command** that conflicts with the other two, OR fails to verify the **TIH Protocol Seals**. | The **inconsistent Agent is immediately isolated** from the network (de-platformed). The remaining two Agents (2/3 Consensus) maintain operation, running the last validated command, while issuing a **Level 1 Alert** to the GCS and Human ATC. |
| **Absolute Compliance Violation (CP Breach)** | The STA calculates the **Compliance Penalty (CP)** to be a massive negative value, indicating a violation of local laws, safety, or airport protocols. | **STA rejects the Harmony Command** and automatically switches to **Sovereign Local Mode (SLM)**, effectively handing over full control to the Human ATC. |

### 2. Failsafe Layer 2: Global Failsafe (Global Consensus System / GCS - N=7)
The global failsafe acts when the network stability itself is threatened, typically due to widespread data anomalies or systemic logical disagreement.

| Trigger (Mechanism Activation) | ZTF Response (Automatic Break) | Failsafe Status & Protocol |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GCS Consensus Failure** | Less than **Four** ($\mathbf{< 4/7}$) Global N-Agents agree on a Harmony Command within the critical time limit (e.g., 50 milliseconds). | **GCS enters Global Read-Only Mode (GROM)**. Harmony Commands cease to be issued network-wide, and all Local Agents (STA) are immediately directed to switch to **Sovereign Local Mode (SLM)**. |
| **Mass STA Isolation** | If $\mathbf{> 50\%}$ of the STAs across the entire global network are in **SLM** or **Level 1 Alert** status. | GCS proactively stops all global command issuance and announces **Network Emergency Mode**, prioritizing consensus recovery over decision-making. |

### 3. Failsafe Layer 3: Ultimate Failsafe (Sovereign Local Mode / SLM)
**SLM is the ultimate *kill switch* for the G-HOST AI system at any airport.**

* **Definition:** **Sovereign Local Mode (SLM)** is the safest operational mode. The STA completely disregards all GCS commands and functions only as a **Data Adapter** for the Human ATCâ€™s existing *legacy* systems.
* **Implication:** The G-HOST AI is functionally **de-activated** at the local terminal, and the Human Controller assumes full responsibility, using the local systems directly.
* **Recovery Protocol:** The STA will only attempt to reconnect to the GCS after receiving a **Physically Verified Recovery Command** issued by the Chief Architect or an HLF-designated technical authority.

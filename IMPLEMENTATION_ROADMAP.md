# G-HOST AI: IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP (PHASED ROLLOUT)

This document outlines the mandatory, staged process for deploying the G-HOST AI architecture from the local terminal level (STA) to global operation (GCS). The procedure prioritizes verification, local sovereignty, and risk mitigation over speed.

## Phase I: Local Sovereignty and Validation (STA Deployment)

The objective of Phase I is to establish a secure, compliant local environment before connecting to the Global Consensus System (GCS). This phase is repeated for every Sovereign Terminal Agent (STA) installation.

| Step | Action | Key Outcome & Verification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I.A: Hardware Installation** | Deploy the physical N=3 Local N-Agent hardware (STA cluster) at the designated terminal location. | Physical isolation and power redundancy verified. |
| **I.B: Legacy Adapter Integration** | Integrate the **STA Middleware Adaptor** with the existing local ATC system (*legacy*). | Successful translation of a minimum of 100 simulated commands from "Harmony format" into acceptable local instructions. |
| **I.C: Compliance Calibration (CP)** | Load and calibrate the local regulatory firewall. **The STA must map all local no-fly zones, military corridors, and environmental restrictions.** | **CP (Compliance Penalty)** test passed: a simulated illegal command must trigger an instantaneous **$-\infty$** penalty, proving the command is rejected locally. |
| **I.D: Data Normalization Audit** | Activate the STA Normalization Module to ingest live *legacy* data. | Data consistency check passed: 100% of local ATC data is successfully converted into the GCS-compatible unified format. |
| **I.E: Sovereign Local Mode (SLM)** | Test the **ZERO_TOLERANCE_FAILSAFE** mechanism for SLM takeover. | Successful isolation from all external networks and full local operational control achieved within 5 milliseconds. |

## Phase II: Global Integration and Absolute Shadow Run

The objective of Phase II is to connect the validated STA to the GCS network and verify the AI's decision-making logic against human operators without affecting real traffic.

| Step | Action | Key Outcome & Verification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **II.A: TIH Protocol Activation** | Establish the secure link between the Local STA and the Decentralized GCS network using the **TIH Protocol** (Quantum Timestamp, Nonce, PQC Hash). | Zero packet loss and PQC cryptographic handshake verified across a 48-hour continuous test period. |
| **II.B: Absolute Consensus Verification** | GCS begins processing live global flight data, issuing **Harmony Commands** for the integrated STA location. | **Harmony Score (S)** calculation audit: The $\mathbf{N=7}$ agents must achieve $\geq 4/7$ consensus for 99.99% of all calculated decisions. |
| **II.C: Shadow Run Engagement** | The STA receives Harmony Commands but **does not execute them**. It compares the AI's command (speed, altitude, routing) with the Human ATC operator's final instruction. | **Harmonic Accuracy Metric:** The AI's predicted outcome must achieve $\geq 95\%$ accuracy compared to the real-world outcome, with a Variance Penalty (VP) reduction of 15% compared to the historical baseline. |
| **II.D: Legacy Rollback Test** | Stress-test the Legacy System Integration: Simulate a command failure and verify the **Automatic Rollback function** successfully reverts the legacy system to the Last Validated State. | Rollback integrity confirmed within the critical time threshold (defined in **GHOST_AI_SPEC.md**). |

## Phase III: Phased Go-Live (Full Automation)

The objective of Phase III is the gradual, controlled transfer of authority from human operators to the G-HOST AI system, guided by the local STA cluster.

| Step | Action | Key Outcome & Verification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **III.A: Low-Traffic Activation** | Transfer authority to G-HOST AI for a controlled, low-traffic environment (e.g., night flights or specific remote sectors). | **Time Certainty** established: Actual flight arrival times must match the AI's predicted arrival times with a deviation of less than $\mathbf{t=30 \text{ seconds}}$ for 99% of controlled flights. |
| **III.B: Full Sector Integration** | Expand G-HOST AI authority to moderate and high-traffic sectors under direct human supervision. | **Full VP Reduction Target Met:** Demonstrated sustainable reduction in overall network Variance Penalty ($\mathbf{W_3} \cdot \mathbf{VP}$) across all controlled flights. |
| **III.C: Regulatory Transfer & Final Sign-off** | Formal acceptance of the system's operational control by the local government/ATC authority, based on audit results from Phases I and II. | Official **Compliance Record (CR)** certification secured for the local region. |

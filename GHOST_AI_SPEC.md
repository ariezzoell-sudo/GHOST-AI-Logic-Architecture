# G-HOST AI FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE SPECIFICATION (REVISION 3.0)

This document details the functional and risk mitigation aspects of the G-HOST AI Architecture.

### 1. Dual N-Agent Architecture Structure

| Layer | Component | Core Function | Risk Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Global (GCS)** | N=7 Decentralized N-Agents | Executes the Absolute Harmony Function and guarantees decisions via **Absolute Consensus** ($\geq 4/7$ agree). | Prevents total system failure (*Zero-Day*) and isolates inconsistent Local Agents. |
| **Local (STA)** | N=3 Local N-Agents (Per Airport) | Acts as the **Sovereign Translator**, guaranteeing AI commands are 100% compliant with local law. | **Sabotage Defense:** Three servers cross-audit each other to prevent local data manipulation. |

---

### 2. Functional Security Protocols

* **TIH Protocol (Tatanan Integritas Harmoni):** All GCS $\leftrightarrow$ STA packets must possess Three Seals: **Quantum Timestamp, Nonce** (to prevent *Replay Attacks*), and **PQC Cryptographic Hash**.
* **QC-Defense:** All functional encryption must use **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography** (Lattice-based) standards.

### 3. Architectural Implementation Challenge Solutions

| Technical Implementation Problem | Designated Architectural Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Heterogeneous Data Normalization** | **STA Normalization Module:** Each STA must have an IP engine to convert different ATC data formats (from various countries) into a single, unified, and standard format for GCS. |
| **Real-time Latency** | **Functional Edge Computing:** The architecture must utilize Edge computing (at the STA location) and dedicated high-speed **NPU/TPU** resources for the GCS, guaranteeing Consensus is reached in milliseconds. |
| **Legacy System Integration** | **STA Middleware Adaptor:** The STA serves as a *middleware* layer that translates **Harmony Commands** into simple instructions acceptable to non-replaceable old ATC systems (*legacy* systems). |

### 4. Real-World Validation Scenarios

| Critical Scenario | Architectural Response | Key Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Extreme Weather Crisis (Global Disruption)** | **Total Network Optimization:** GCS calculates the *Least-Variance route* (lowest VP). It forces measured delays at the origin and speed adjustments en-route to eliminate *holding patterns* at the destination. | **Variance Penalty (VP):** Prioritized as the highest weight ($\mathbf{W_3}$), forcing the AI to choose certain delay over airborne uncertainty. |
| **2. Military Intervention/Sovereignty (Rapid Regulatory Change)** | **Absolute Rejection of Global Command:** If a Harmony Command violates a new no-fly zone, the **Local STA** will instantly reject the command. | **Compliance Penalty (CP):** CP spikes to a massive negative value ($-\infty$), nullifying the Harmony Score. **STA (Sovereign Terminal Agent):** Isolates the local system until compliance is verified. |
| **3. Total Communication Outage (GCS $\leftrightarrow$ STA Disconnection)** | **Full Local Autonomy:** The STA immediately activates the **Sovereign Local Mode (SLM)**. The three local $\mathbf{N=3}$ agents take over full tactical authority, operating on a refined set of *failsafe* protocols. | **SLM Failsafe Protocols:** **Landing Priority:** Focuses on safest descent (CP and ZTF only, ignoring Wn). **Emergency Rerouting:** Uses pre-loaded ZTF vectors for immediate local diversion. |

### 5. Extended Validation Scenarios

| Critical Scenario | Architectural Response | Key Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **4. Global Cyber Attack on GCS Agents (Sabotage)** | **Agent Isolation and Blacklisting:** If $N$ agents start outputting non-consensus or malicious VP/CR/DM scores, the remaining agents (the Consensus Majority) isolate and blacklist the malfunctioning agents. GCS continues operating with the reduced $N'$ set (e.g., $N=5$) until the suspect agents are verified offline. | **Absolute Consensus Algorithm:** The core strength of the $N=7$ model; it sustains operation even with up to 3 malicious/failed agents. |
| **5. Massive Data Input Error (Human Error)** | **Local Data Quarantine:** The STA's $\mathbf{N=3}$ agents detect that the incoming local ATC data (e.g., runway status) is statistically impossible or illogical (e.g., *legacy* system error). The STA issues a **Data Quarantine**, uses the last valid data set, and activates the *human-in-the-loop* alert system for verification. | **STA Cross-Audit:** The $\mathbf{N=3}$ STA agents compare data streams for logical consistency, preventing erroneous *legacy* input from corrupting Harmony Logic. |
| **6. Full System Recovery (Post-Incident)** | **Synchronized Re-Entry:** After a failure (deadlock or outage), GCS (Global) and STA (Local) only re-synchronize using the **TIH Protocol**. The GCS uses the quantum timestamp to find the **Last Validated State (LVS)** for the entire network, ensuring all agents restart from the same clean time-point. | **TIH Protocol:** The quantum timestamp guarantees the integrity of the LVS, preventing data conflict or time-related inconsistency during recovery. |

### 6. Audit, Logging, and Transparency

To meet the highest standards of regulatory compliance and auditability:

* **Immutable Audit Trail:** All decisions (including every Harmony Score calculation, $CP$ trigger, and $SLM$ activation) are recorded as an **immutable log** stamped with the **Quantum Timestamp** via the TIH Protocol. This guarantees non-repudiation of all events.
* **Failover Logging:** During any *failover* (SLM or Deadlock), both the isolated **GCS** and the active **STA** continue logging independently. Post-incident, these two logs are cross-referenced to determine the exact moment of failure and the root cause for regulatory investigation.
* **Decision Flowchart Requirement:** All major architectural changes to the decision-making process (e.g., changes to $W_n$ priority) must be accompanied by a **simple, verified flowchart** demonstrating the logic sequence for auditors and integrators.

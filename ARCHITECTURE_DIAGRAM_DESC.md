# G-HOST AI ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM DESCRIPTION

This document serves as the visual description for the G-HOST AI architecture diagram available in this repository.

### 1. Global Consensus System (GCS)

* **Function:** The central component of the system. Consists of **Seven (7) separate N-Agents**.
* **Process:** All N-Agents independently calculate the **Harmony Score**. Decisions (Harmony Commands) are only issued after achieving **Absolute Consensus ($\geq 4$ out of 7 Agents agree)**.
* **Deadlock Protocol (3 vs 4 Split):** If a consensus *deadlock* (3 vs 4 votes, or non-majority split) occurs, the GCS automatically enters a **Suspension Mode**. No new Harmony Commands are issued. The global agents revert to the last universally approved instruction, and all tactical authority is temporarily deferred to the **Sovereign Local Mode (SLM)** at the nearest STA. The GCS prioritizes stability over action during failure.

### 2. Secure Communication Layer

* **Protocol:** GCS to STA communication is protected by the **TIH Protocol (Tatanan Integritas Harmoni)** and **QC-Defense** (Quantum-Resistant) encryption. This guarantees time and data integrity.

### 3. Local Agent (STA - Sovereign Terminal Agent)

* **Structure:** Each Airport has **Three (3) Local N-Agents**. This $\mathbf{N=3}$ structure is the local layer of the Dual N-Agent architecture.
* **Sovereign Role:** The STA is the only entity that interacts with the local ATC system (Legacy System). It acts as the **Sovereign Translator**, ensuring GCS commands are **100% compliant with local law**.
* **N=3 Sabotage Defense Mechanism:** The three Local N-Agents are configured for continuous **cross-audit**. They constantly compare three data streams: (1) incoming local ATC data, (2) the calculated **Compliance Penalty (CP)** status, and (3) the translated Harmony Command. If one Agent reports a discrepancy or inconsistency with the other two ($\mathbf{2/3}$ Consensus failure), the failing Agent is immediately isolated, and the **Sovereign Local Mode (SLM)** is activated, transferring control to local operators.

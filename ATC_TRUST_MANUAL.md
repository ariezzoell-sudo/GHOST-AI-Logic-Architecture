# G-HOST AI: ATC TRUST & HARMONY COMMAND PROTOCOL

This manual outlines the operational trust mechanisms built into the G-HOST AI Architecture to ensure seamless, safe, and compliant collaboration between the AI (via the Sovereign Terminal Agent/STA) and human Air Traffic Control (ATC) operators.

### 1. The Critical Bridge: Sovereign Terminal Agent (STA)
The STA is the only component authorized to translate **Harmony Commands** from the Global Consensus System (GCS) into executable instructions for local ATC systems. The STAâ€™s primary role is to act as the **Sovereign Translator**, guaranteeing ATC trust through three pillars:

### 2. The Three Pillars of ATC Trust

| Trust Pillar | Mechanism (Why it's Safe) | Verification (How to Check) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pillar 1: Legal Compliance (CP Assurance)** | The STA utilizes the **Compliance Penalty (CP)** variable, which prevents any non-compliant command from being executed. The command is legally guaranteed to be compatible with local law and protocols. | **STA Console Log:** Command validity is logged and audited by the N=3 Local Agents before execution. If **CP > 0**, the command is rejected locally. |
| **Pillar 2: Data Integrity (TIH Protocol)** | The **Harmony Integrity Order (TIH) Protocol** protects the command from all forms of manipulation or replay attacks (even quantum-level threats). The message is secure and verified. | **Three Seals of Trust:** ATC must verify the presence of the **Quantum Timestamp, Nonce, and PQC Hash** in the command header before accepting the instruction for transmission. |
| **Pillar 3: Operational Certainty (Harmony Score)** | All Harmony Commands are logically proven to maximize **Time Certainty** across the global network (VP is minimized). The command is not merely optimizing cost; it is enforcing stability. | **Real-time Metrics:** The system provides the ATC with a localized **Predicted VP Reduction** metric (demonstrating the stability benefit of the command). |

### 3. Procedure for Command Rejection (Human Veto)
In rare, unforeseen circumstances (e.g., immediate, non-electronic safety failures), an ATC operator may need to temporarily override a Harmony Command.

* **Action:** Operator issues a formal **Veto of Harmony Command (VHC)** via the STA interface.
* **Result:** The STA logs the VHC, isolates the local N-Agents, and immediately alerts the GCS. The GCS recalculates the Absolute Harmony Function based on the human VHC constraint and issues a new, stable command within milliseconds.
